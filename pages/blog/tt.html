                        <p>
                            When I began my journey as a developer, I was quite
                            intrigued with the vastness of Computer Science and
                            the innumerable opportunities that it had. I was
                            quite confused, ‘What do I learn ??’, <b>Web
                                Development, App Development, AI, Cloud
                                Computing
                                etc, and in addition to these, so many
                                programming
                                languages.</b> Let's look at what this Tutorial
                            trap is,
                            and then on how to get away from it..
                        </p>
                        <p>First and foremost the most important thing is
                            passion, do something that excites you, that
                            fascinates you, so that doing it won't lead to
                            boredom and you will be consistent with your work.
                            If programming is not something that you are
                            passionate about, keep exploring until you find what
                            drives you, keep experimenting, keep failing, it
                            does not matter because at the end of the day we
                            ought to be proud and happy with ourselves, <b>that's
                                what matters !!.</b></p>
                        <p>
                            As the name suggests, Tutorial trap is getting
                            trapped in this never ending loop of jumping from
                            one tutorial to the other. You might wonder, <b>Why
                                is
                                it a trap ? Isn't it a good thing that we are
                                doing
                                courses and learning new things every time ?
                            </b>Well,
                            from my experience I must say that it’s really
                            frustrating and exhausting and definitely not at all
                            a good idea. This way you will not see any progress
                            in developing your career, at least I didn’t while I
                            was trapped here and neither did my friends
                            (developer buddies).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You think about it .…. you keep learning, learning
                            and learning, but never really implement whatever
                            you've learnt. You're not typing any code, not
                            coming across bugs, not testing, and not failing,
                            then how will you learn? It's a proven fact that
                            only when you implement the things you learn, you
                            improve and understand it better. I have experienced
                            it as well and I am sure some of the pros reading
                            this have experienced the same. If you have the
                            knowledge, but have no skill implementing it then
                            you have wasted your time acquiring it. If you are
                            in this trap where you are constantly learning new
                            programming languages one after the other, or
                            learning new tech stacks one after the other, please
                            stop doing it. <b>You will get nowhere and it's
                                going
                                to take a toll on your head.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have been reading this amazing book <b>‘The 7
                                Habits
                                of highly effective people’ by Stephen R. Covey
                                (I
                                suggest you all give it a read).</b> In this the
                            author
                            talks about something known as P/PC balance. I will
                            just give a brief of what it is and if you want more
                            insight on it, do check the book out. So here, in
                            P/PC, the P stands for Production and PC stands for
                            Production Capability. Production is the outcome of
                            Production Capability. Production Capability is what
                            you learn through courses/tutorials and Production
                            is how you develop something out of what you have
                            learnt. The balance here is very important and if
                            not maintained, could lead to negativity or you
                            might even consider quitting. </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How to get rid of it ? </b>....it’s pretty
                            simple. In
                            terms of learning a new language, let’s say you have
                            learnt Python as your first language, don't jump
                            into something else after you have got your basics
                            right (please read my previous blog). Use your
                            Python knowledge and build some simple projects
                            using it. Try solving coding problems using
                            Python.This way you will be typing, coming across a
                            lot of bugs (and bugs are really good to come across
                            too, you learn and get to know so many different
                            things) <b>I love bugs, to be honest!!.</b>
